# CNRS project conv - Control of NV centers

Colour centres are an innovative alternative for storing and processing quantum information under laboratory conditions that are
much less restrictive than other quantum systems. In order to go beyond proof of concept, it is necessary to make the operation of colour centres
more efficient and robust. The mathematical study of sets of coupled spins is based on optimal control theory, guided by the possibility of
numerically simulating and optimising control fields for such systems. The control laws thus determined can be implemented in the laboratory on a spin network using a state-of-the-art confocal microscope.
